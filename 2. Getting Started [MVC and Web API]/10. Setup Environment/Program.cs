/// We need a Visual Studio
/// SQL server.
/// Postman
/// 
/// visual studio is the preferred IDE to
/// create and develop asp.net core web applications.
/// 
/// and you will require sql server for databases.
/// 
/// and you require postman in order to test your controllers by sending a
/// request.
/// 
/// but we will install the other two in the respective sections.
/// 
/// I already have the visual studio and SQL server i.e. SSMS.
/// 
/// For VS:
/// Goto https://visualstudio.microsoft.com
/// For learning purposes and also for small teams in production the community is enough.
/// So prefer installing community 2022.
/// 
/// Once installed, window will pop up to download Workloads.
/// 
/// Select 
/// ASP.NET and web development.
/// 
/// Now select Individual Components tab.
/// here optionally you can select dot net 5 runtime.
/// so that you will be able to use dotnet 5 or dotnet 6 as per the choice.
/// but in case if you are not interested in dotnet 5 it is not required it is optional.
/// There are dot net frameworks in the list also.
/// These dotnet framework components are optional in case if you are planning to use asp.net mvc by using dotnet framework
/// then only you require all these components otherwise not required.
/// So in our course perspective these components are not required.
/// 
/// Click on install button.
