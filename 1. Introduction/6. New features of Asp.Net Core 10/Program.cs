Where to find new features of Asp.Net Core 8, 9 & 10

The improvements from version 6 to 10 are very minor and not relavant to any of the topics covered in this course.".
Of course, version 7, 8 9 and 10 has new improvements in Blazor, which is out-of-context for this course.

So as far as this course is concerned:

We are using Asp.Net Core 6(LTS - Long Term Support) version for the first 25 sections of this course. 
ALL of those lectures are exactly same in Asp.Net Core 8 as well. The same code works in version 10, without NO changes.

The "Web API" (Section 26) uses Asp.Net Core 8. The same code works in version 10, without NO changes.
