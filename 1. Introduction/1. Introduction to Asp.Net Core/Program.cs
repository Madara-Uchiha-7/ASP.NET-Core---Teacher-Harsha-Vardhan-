/// What is ASP.NET core.
/// It is a cross-platform high
/// performance open source web application development framework.
/// 
/// So using asp.net core you can create web
/// applications and services.
/// that means you can create web applications of any scale small medium and complex web applications
/// and you can create rest API Services which can act as a backend for web applications and mobile applications.
/// 
/// Features:
/// It is the cross platform
/// After completion of your asp.net core application development you require to host it
/// means you're required to install it on your server machine, so that it starts receiving the requests
/// from the client and providing the response for the same.
/// So what kind of operating system required on the server machine.
/// asp.net core supports three mainly:
/// Windows Linux and Mac
/// 
/// Generally in most of the cases we use Windows or Mac on the developer machine
/// and Linux on the server machine
/// 
/// and on the server machine there should be a software that can receive the request and can provide the response
/// which is also called as reverse proxies.
/// asp.net core supports kestrel by default as application server and the remaining as reverse proxies
/// that is IIS, nginx and docker, where the docker itself supports various operating systems.
/// 
/// You can run Windows or Linux on the docker.
/// Our asp.net core application can run on any of these servers.
/// 
/// It is open source.
/// That means the source code of asp.net core is available on GitHub for free.
/// 
/// asp.net core is developed keeping cloud in mind.
/// That means it supports Microsoft Azure Cloud out of the box.
/// 
/// 
/// There are totally four parts of asp.net:
/// 1. asp.net core MVC 
/// 2. asp.net core web API
/// 3. Razor pages 
/// 4. Blazor
/// 
/// Most of the web applications are developed using asp.net core MVC itself and this should not be confused with
/// asp.net MVC which was available earlier in dotnet framework.
/// Whenever you are going to use model view and controller pattern in asp.net core, it is called as asp.net core MVC
/// and in case if you create only controllers with models but no views it is said to be asp.net core web API.
/// 
/// Generally asp.net core web API is used to create restful services.
/// So that it can receive the request and provide the data as response, only the data but not the views so that the front end can be created by
/// using any one of the web application or mobile application Frameworks.
/// Such as for example you can create front end by using react, angular or mobile application Frameworks such as
/// xamarin or ionic. For all these front ends the web API can act as a backend.
/// In addition to that for simple and page focused scenarios razor pages is available and if the development team would like
/// to use only c-sharp language both on the server side as well as client side also then you will prefer using asp.net Blazor 
/// out of all these four flavors
///
